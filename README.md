# MyPortfolio

In this homework assignment I have created a portfolio page for myself. I filled what I could on the listing. Of course I dont have a lot of skillsets yet in relation to development so I just named off some topics. For the list of projects I have included a side project I have been working on and a link to the first homework assignment just so it doesn'l look so empty, I hope that is ok.
